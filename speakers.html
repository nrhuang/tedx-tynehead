                        <p>Juliana is an incoming Grade 12 in Holy Cross Regional High School. As the founder of the Vancouver Kindness Movement, Juliana organizes shoreline clean-ups, donation drives, and hosts online workshops to raise awareness with the youth on the necessity of kindness in the world. She has a passion for music: Juliana sings soprano and plays the piano and the trumpet for her school's Concert Choir, Jazz Choir, Jazz Band, and Wind Ensemble. She also sings in the Vancouver Youth Choir. In her spare time, Juliana enjoys photography, video editing, and creating digital art. Through her hobbies and passions in business, she organized a Canada-wide virtual choir and band ensemble called Melodies of Youth. The purpose of this initiative was to raise funds for the benefit of Covenant House Vancouver. In total, the ensemble had over 40+ musicians all across the provinces of Canada. For fun, Juliana plays on her school's volleyball team and is an enthusiastic player on its ultimate frisbee squad. She loves ramen and boba, sometimes at the same time. She invariably breaks out into song when she is relaxed; her family is used to it by now.</p>
