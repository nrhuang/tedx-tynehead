                        <p>Jacqueline is currently pursuing her Bachelor of Architecture degree with a minor in Real Estate Finance at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. From an early age, she discovered her strong passion and curiosity for architecture and design. She believes that architecture and design has the responsibility to generate value for society by creating meaningful experiences. To her, architecture is not only a building or structure, but also has a deeper mission to bridge gaps, connect people, and provide innovative solutions to many of the challenges that society faces. Jacqueline has previously gained experience as an intern architectural designer at award-winning firms MAD Architects in Beijing, China, and Revery Architecture in Vancouver, Canada, and has further explored her interest in real estate development by gaining experience on the Design and Development team at Westbank Corp. in Vancouver, Canada. Extremely honored and ecstatic to attend this TEDx event, Jacqueline hopes to inspire the audience by sharing her path to discovering the beauty and appreciation for architecture.</p>

For fun, Juliana plays on her school's volleyball team and is an enthusiastic player on its ultimate frisbee squad. She loves ramen and boba, sometimes at the same time. She invariably breaks out into song when she is relaxed; her family is used to it by now.</p>
